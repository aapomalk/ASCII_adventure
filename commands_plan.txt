commands:
	left
	right
	stop
	wait
	jump
	grab
	grabLadder
	drop
	up
	down
	shoot
	use

left:
	move to left (or turn to left)
	syntax: left_amount_velocity
	amount is integer (could also be negative -> walking backwards)
	amount can also be "inf" -> infinity - moves until hits a wall (or
	       something that the player can interact with, e.g. ladder)
	velocity is integer (between 1 and 10)
	the unit of velocity is 0.1 squares / time unit
	    -> 1 means that it takes 10 time units for one square,
	    and 10 means that it takes 1 time units for one square

right:
	similar as left

stop:
	stops the movement
	cancels left/right before jump

wait:
	waits in the current state for x time
	if moving -> causes stop (unless in air)
	syntax: wait_amount
	amount is positive integer

jump:
	jump up
	if done while moving (last command is left or right) then jump is
	   also moving (see stop)
	syntax: jump_height
	height is positive integer (between 1 and 5)
	stops at the highest point of trajectory and/or if possibility to
	      interact
	to synchronize the jump and walking:
	   to jump 1 up takes 3 time units
	   jump 2 up takes 6 time units
	   3 up takes 8
	   4 up takes 9, and
	   5 up takes 10 time units
	falling takes the same time, but after falling 5, one more comes in one
		time unit (e.g. 6 down takes 11 time units)

grab:
	grab ladder or weapon
	syntax: grab_handNumber
	if the handNumber (1 or 2) holds another item or ladder
	   -> drop happens at the same time
	if there is item and ladder at the same square the item is grabbed
	if one wants to grab the ladder instead then grabLadder must be used

grabLadder
	syntax: grabLadder_handNumber
	if requires dropping an item but there is already an item in the same
	square -> nothing happens

drop:
	release the grab
	syntax: drop_handNumber
	handNumber is either 1 or 2
	drop for weapon cannot be used when another weapon is in the same square

weapon and ladder and possibly other items:
        there can be only one item at one square
	-> the items can pile up
	ladder is always behind
	if there is an item 

up:
	moves up the ladder
	syntax: up_amount_velocity
	see left

down:
	same as up, but moves down the ladder

shoot:
	shoots the weapon
	syntax: shoot_upAmount_sideAmount_handNumber
	upAmount and sideAmount define the highest point of trajectory
	the limits differ with each weapon
	for some weapons the amounts work as an aiming point
	handNumber defines which weapon to use (one can carry two weapons max)

use:
	uses the item in hand
	syntax: use_handNumber
	different effects for different items

enemies:
	there are several different enemies
	not moving and moving
	attacking and not attacking
	small and large
	ones that you can destroy and ones you can't
	ones that create other enemies
	intelligent and stupid
